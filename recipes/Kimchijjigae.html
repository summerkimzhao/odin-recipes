    <h1>Kimchi Jjigae (Korean Kimchi Soup)</h1>
    <img src="../images/Kimchijjigae.jpg">
    <h4> There are so many ways to make Kimchijjigae. I have several recipes, but this is a good one to feed a crowd as Spam is a relatively cheaper protein option. I never took a photo of my Kimchi jjigae before. I'll update the photo soon.

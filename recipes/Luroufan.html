    <h1>Lu Rou Fan (Taiwanese Braised Pork Belly)</h1>
    <img src="../images/Luroufan.jpg">
    <h4> This is my take on Lu Rou Fan, a Taiwanese braised pork belly dish. 
        It takes a bit of time to make the broth and to braise, but it is so worth it! It's best to cook in a large portion since it takes a long time to cook!

    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Submerge the pork belly in cold water overnight. I put them in the fridge submerged in the water. (alternatively, you can par boil the meat) in order to get rid of the porky smell</li>
    <li>In a medium pot, put all the broth ingredients and boil them with 8 cups of water</li>
    <Li>Cut pork into 1x1in cube size</Li>
    <li>In a large dutch oven or a pot, fry the pork cubes for at least 10 mins. (I tried to fry them as long as possible - until water evaporated or until they got brown) towards the end, add minced garlic and ginger to stir fry for another 5mins. </li>
    <li>Add all the 'Sauce group 1.' Add broth until pork is barely submerged in the pot (you may not use up all 8 cups of broth. I always seem to have left over borth, which I can use for other soup)</li>
    <li>Bring them to boil. Once it boils, reduce the heat to medium low and let it lightly boil for 45min-1hr, lid closed. </li>
    <li>In a separate pot, boil 12 eggs to the doneness of your liking. </li>
    <li>Add the 'Sauce group 2' and boiled eggs and bring it to hard boil once more. </li>
    <li>Once it boils, reduce the heat to medium low and let it lightly boil until the liquid gets reduced and thickens (usually another 1-2hrs), lid open. </li>
